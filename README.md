Breast Cancer Classification Analysis
This project focuses on the classification of breast cancer tumors as either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) using machine learning models. The analysis involves data exploration, preprocessing, and the implementation of classification algorithms to build a predictive model based on real-world patient data.

üìä Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset, which includes 569 records with 32 features. The features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass and describe characteristics of the cell nuclei.

‚ú® Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Comprehensive analysis to understand the dataset's structure, identify patterns, and visualize the distribution of key features.

Data Preprocessing: Steps to clean and prepare the data for modeling, including handling missing values and feature scaling.

Model Building: Development of two distinct machine learning models:

Logistic Regression: A simple and effective linear model for binary classification.

Random Forest: An ensemble method that provides high accuracy and insights into feature importance.

Model Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using various metrics to determine their effectiveness in cancer diagnosis.

üíª Technologies and Libraries Used
Python: The core programming language for the project.

Jupyter Notebook: The primary environment for conducting the analysis, providing a step-by-step workflow.

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: For numerical operations.

scikit-learn: A powerful machine learning library for model building, evaluation, and data preprocessing.

matplotlib & seaborn: For creating visualizations and plots to aid in EDA.

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine.

Required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).

Running the Analysis
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Breast-Cancer-Classification.git](https://github.com/your-username/Breast-Cancer-Classification.git)
cd Breast-Cancer-Classification

Note: Replace your-username with your GitHub username.

Download the dataset:
Ensure the breast-cancer.csv file is in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.

Launch Jupyter Notebook:
Run the following command in your terminal:

jupyter notebook

This will open the Jupyter interface in your browser.

Open and run the notebook:
Navigate to and open the BreastCancerDataset.ipynb file. You can run each cell sequentially to see the full analysis, from data loading and EDA to model training and prediction.
